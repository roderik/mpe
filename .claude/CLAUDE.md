| Provides guidance for property-based testing across multiple languages and smart contracts. Use when writing tests, reviewing code with serialization/validation/parsing patterns, designing features, or when property-based testing would provide stronger coverage than example-based tests. | `Skill({ skill: "property-based-testing" })` |
| Parse, analyze, and process SARIF (Static Analysis Results Interchange Format) files. Use when reading security scan results, aggregating findings from multiple tools, deduplicating alerts, extracting specific vulnerabilities, or integrating SARIF data into CI/CD pipelines. | `Skill({ skill: "sarif-parsing" })` |
| Guide you through Trail of Bits' 5-step secure development workflow. Runs Slither scans, checks special features (upgradeability/ERC conformance/token integration), generates visual security diagrams, helps document security properties for fuzzing/verification, and reviews manual security areas. (project, gitignored) | `Skill({ skill: "secure-workflow-guide" })` |

| Identifies error-prone APIs, dangerous configurations, and footgun designs that enable security mistakes. Use when reviewing API designs, configuration schemas, cryptographic library ergonomics, or evaluating whether code follows 'secure by default' and 'pit of success' principles. Triggers: footgun, misuse-resistant, secure defaults, API usability, dangerous configuration. | `Skill({ skill: "sharp-edges" })` |
| Use when executing implementation plans with independent tasks in the current session | `Skill({ skill: "subagent-driven-development" })` |

| Use when implementing any feature or bugfix, before writing implementation code | `Skill({ skill: "test-driven-development" })` |
| Comprehensive token integration and implementation analyzer based on Trail of Bits' token integration checklist. Analyzes token implementations for ERC20/ERC721 conformity, checks for 20+ weird token patterns, assesses contract composition and owner privileges, performs on-chain scarcity analysis, and evaluates how protocols handle non-standard tokens. Context-aware for both token implementations and token integrations. (project, gitignored) | `Skill({ skill: "token-integration-analyzer" })` |
| Master TypeScript's advanced type system including generics, conditional types, mapped types, template literals, and utility types for building type-safe applications. Use when implementing complex type logic, creating reusable type utilities, or ensuring compile-time type safety in TypeScript projects. | `Skill({ skill: "typescript-advanced-types" })` |
